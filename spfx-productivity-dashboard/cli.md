## Try sample with Teams Toolkit CLI

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Recommend LTS 18.x)
2. To install the Teams Toolkit CLI, use the npm package manager:

    ```
    npm install -g @microsoft/teamsapp-cli
    ```

3. Create spfx-productivity-dashboard project.

    ```
    teamsapp new sample spfx-productivity-dashboard --interactive false
    ```

4. Provision the project to create an app in Teams App Studio.

    ```
    teamsapp provision
    ```

5. Deploy your project.
    > This step will generate a SharePoint package (*.sppkg) under `sharepoint/solution` folder. The cli will automatically upload and deploy it to your tenant App Catalog site. Only tenant App Catalog site admin has permission to do it. If you are not the admin, you can create your test tenant following [Setup your Microsoft 365 tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant).

    ```
    teamsapp deploy
    ```

6. Go to your [SharePoint Admin center](https://{yourtenant}-admin.sharepoint.com). In the left-hand navigation, select `Advanced` and then `API Access`. You should see pending requests for each of the permissions requested in src\config\package-solution.json file. Select and approve each permission.
