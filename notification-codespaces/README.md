# Getting Started with Notification Sample

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=v3&repo=348288141&machine=basicLinux32gb&location=WestUs2&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fnotification-codespaces%2Fdevcontainer.json&resume=1)

This sample showcases an app that send a message to Teams with Adaptive Cards triggered by a HTTP post request. You can further extend the sample to consume, transform and post events to individual, chat or channel in Teams.

The app is built using the TeamsFx SDK, which provides a simple set of functions over the Microsoft Bot Framework to implement this scenario.

## This sample illustrates
- How to use Teams Toolkit build a notification app.
- How to use [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to run and preview a message extension in Teams.

## Prerequisite to use this sample
- A GitHub account which will be used to create a codespace with fully configured dev environments in the cloud. 
- A Microsoft 365 tenant in which you have permission to upload Teams apps. You can get a free Microsoft 365 developer tenant by joining the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program).

## Minimal path to awesome

### Run the app in Codespaces
1. Click [Open in GitHub Codespaces badge](#getting-started-with-notification-sample) to create a codespace for the sample app.

    > Note: you can customize the creation options (e.g. region, machine type) according to your needs.

1. Once your codespace is created, Select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar. And then select `Preview your Teams app (F5)` from Teams Toolkit or simply press `F5` to run and preview your application.

1. When Teams Web Client is launched in the browser, select the `Add` button in the dialog to install your app to Teams.

   > **Note**: You may need to **allow pop-ups** so that Codespace can open a new browser to sideload the app to Teams:

1. Open a terminal in your Codespaces, and send a POST request to the app with the following command:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3978/api/notification
   ```

   The application will send an Adaptive Card to Teams:
