# Getting Started with SSO Enabled Tab via APIM Proxy Sample (Azure)

Microsoft Teams supports the ability to run web-based UI inside "custom tabs" that users can install either for just themselves (personal tabs) or within a team or group chat context.

SSO Enabled Tab via APIM Proxy shows you how to build a tab app with Graph Toolkit as frontend and Azure API Management as proxy to get user login information with SSO.

With this sample, you can achieve the SSO feature in your tab app using OBO (on-behalf-of) flow without building a dedicated backend service.
